# Greenhouse-Monitoring-System
The Greenhouse Monitoring System is an IoT solution that monitors temperature, humidity, and light in greenhouses using Zolertia-based sensors. Data is securely sent to AWS for real-time processing and displayed in a Flutter app. The system is scalable and can easily integrate new sensors or additional greenhouses.
